/boot -> contains the kernel, initial RAM disk and other files for the boot
vmlinux -> normal kernel
vmlinuz -> compressed kernel
/proc/cmdline -> parameters passed through to the kernel for the booting process

System and startup managers:
SysVinit -> used in earlier Debian and RH distros - serial boot process
Upstart -> developed by Ubuntu
systemd -> the latest - start services in paralel

top -p X -> display only the process for PID X

systemd-analyze -> display the boot time
systemd-analyze blame -> display a list of all running units ordered by the time they took to initialize

grub-install /dev/sda -> install GRUB in the MBR
grub-install /dev/sda1 -> install GRUB in the first sector of the partition

GRUB2
----------
/boot/grub/grub.cfg -> config file for GRUB2
- the GRUB2 config file is usually generated rather than editing it
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
- edits are not made directly to grub.cfg
/etc/default/grub

Reset root password - RH
----------
- boot to the initialization ram disk

fsck -> is calling other utilities for checking the file systems:
	- e2fsck for ext2
	- xfs_repair for xfs
	- btrfsck for btrfs
fsck -A -> check all file systems from fstab with fsckpass>0

Manage disk quotas
----------
- quotas are applied to a file system as a mount option
- we can apply quotas to a user or to a group

apt-get install quota
yum install quota

who -> check who is loggen on
/etc/nologin -> when created, other users cannot login

- 666 for files
- 777 for folders

umask -> set default permissions by removing them
0 or - -> no permissions
4 or r -> read
2 or w -> write
1 or x -> execute

chown user:group file
chgrp group file

Special permissions
-----------
- set user ID bit
- set group ID bit
- sticky bit

- sticky bit - when set on a folder, you can only delete the files you own - indicated by the lowercase t
- uppercase T indicates that the execute permission is not set for others
chmod o+t folder
chmod 1777 folder

- set group ID bit - set on executable -> the executable runs with the group ID of the owner group
- when set on a folder -> all new files are going to be group owned by the group owner of the folder
chmod 2777 folder -> set group ID bit
chmod 3777 folder -> set group ID bit + sticky bit

- set user ID bit - set on executable -> the executable runs with the UID of th owner of the file

Symbolic (soft) links
---------
ln -s source destination
find / -type l -xtype l -> look for broken links

==============================================
System files and their correct location
---------
FHS -> File system Hierachical Standard:
- shareable and static directories - accessible to all users, but not usually written to - often programs or documentation
/usr, /opt etc
- shareable and variable folders - shared folders that will be written to by users
/var/mail, /var/spool/cups
- unshareable and static folders - config and boot folders
/etc, /boot
- unshareable and variable folders - will be written to by root or services
/var/run, /var/lock

Finding files
---------
find -name 'file*' -type f -> the AND between the 2 conditions is implicit
find -name 'file*' -o -type f -> -o for OR
find -type f NOT -iname 'file*' -> find files that don't have 'file' in their name

locate -> search indexed DB
updatedb -> cron job or command to update the DB for locate
